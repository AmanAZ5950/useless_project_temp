# [PROXIMITY DETECTOR USING ULTRASONIC SENSOR] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [ROBOTICS]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [Aman abdulla] - [saintgits college of engineering]
- Member 2: [Allen thomas alex] - [saintgits college of engineering]
- Member 3: [Name] - [College]

### Project Description
[-We can use it to trigger alarm when the object comes or sees in a certain distance
-without a certain trigger distance we can use it to measure certain distances]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[imagine we are turning on the water tank pump and forgets to turn it off and the wayer overflows and our mother scolds us  ]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[thats where our projects comes we can detect the surface distance and use a sound alarm to remind us]

first we connected the arduino boadr with the systerm then connected the ultrasonic sensor then got the code from chat gtp then modified it in arduino IED and uploaded the code to the board did some trial then 
connected the buzzer then added the commands to the code then uploded it again then last we added the LED light and modified the code again then atlast addeed the code then did some trials then uploaded the code to the board
*Explain the final build*
